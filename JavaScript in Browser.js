//JavaScript in the Browser
//JS was initially created to make web pages alive. JS can be written right in a web pages HTML to make it interactive.

//The browser has an embedded engine called the JavaScript engine or the JavaScript runtime.

//JavaScript's ability in the browser is very limited to protect the users safety. For ex a webpage on http://goofle.com cannot access http://codeswear.com and steal information from there.

//F12 on Chrome opens Dev tools.
/*Elements- Gives all HTML elements
  Console- Shows all errors + logs
